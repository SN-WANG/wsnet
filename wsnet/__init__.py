WSNet: A Deep Learning Library for Engineering Surrogate Modeling.

WSNet is an integrated deep learning library specifically designed for high-fidelity surrogate modeling
in engineering applications. It provides a unified pipeline for fluid dynamics emulation, structural
analysis, and design optimization with comprehensive support for classical surrogate models, neural
networks, and modern neural operator algorithms.

The library follows a consistent "initialize, fit, predict" pattern across all models and training
frameworks, making it easy to use for both research and production applications.

Key Features:
- CFD-Ready Pipeline: Direct ingestion of ANSYS Fluent data with automatic coordinate and field mapping
- Physics-Informed Training: Support for physics constraints and loss functions
- Multi-Fidelity Support: Comprehensive multi-fidelity modeling capabilities
- Ensemble Methods: Advanced ensemble techniques for improved accuracy
- Neural Operator Algorithms: Modern neural operator implementations for complex physics
- Comprehensive Visualization Tools: Built-in CFD visualization and rendering
